<h2>Welcome to the NDEx BETA Test Site</h2>

<p>
    This is the test site for NDEx, the Network Data Exchange.
</p>

<p>
    NDEx is open-source, web-based software system to enable
    individuals, groups, and software applications to share, store,
    manipulate, and publish biological network knowledge.
</p>

<p>
    This test site will allow users to create accounts and
    upload networks, the site and its underlying database are not
    guaranteed to be stable or persistent. If you create an account and
    upload content, that content may not be present when you return to the
    site - during the development process, we will frequently need to
    re-create and reload the test database.
</p>

<p>
    If you encounter problems while testing, you can report
    them to <a href="mailto:support@ndexbio.org?Subject=NDEx%20Issue" target="_top">NDEx Support</a>.
    We would especially appreciate an email if you encounter <b>any</b> situation
    in which the site becomes inoperable.
